# History-168A
Notes for Berkeley's History 168A, the chronicle of the Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire

I also wrote a vocab finder to make it easier to find definitions of words.

usage: vocabToBullets.py [-h] -v V [-o O]
Find relevant bullets.
optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -v V        the input vocab file
  -o O        the output file (optional)

Sample: python vocabToBullets.py -v words.txt
